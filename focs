Five 0'Clock Shadow (FOCS) is a framework for fuzzing things using QEMU and AFL++. Its primpary focus is on fuzzing firmware
binaries from non-x86 architectures. This measn you have to use it in a number of unique ways. Here are the ones that really
matter:

1. You must have AFL++ installed and have afl-fuzz and afl-cmin in your $PATH. If you don't FOCS won't work.
2. FOCS is meant to be run from the root direcotry of an extracted firmware binary. It stores data related
to the banner that will matter in the future in /usr/share/focs/firmware_library (but you can change this
by editing the source code), and that information can only be collected if FOCS is run from an appropriate
directory.
3. @@ is an AFL specific option that is meant to indicate where input should replace the @@ while fuzzing. E.g.,
If the test case is 'asdf' then 'afl-fuzz -i in -o out cat @@' would literally execute 'cat asdf'. This is different
from not using the @@ option, which is more akin to executing 'cat < asdf'. Both versions have their uses, and testing
is required to determine if the binary you are fuzzing needs the @@ or not, HOWEVER: @@ IS THE SAFE OPTION HERE!!! IT
IS NOT INCLUDED BY DEFAULT, SO IT IS SAFER TO ENTER '@@' WHEN PROMPTED TO ENTER ARGUMENTS!!!.

EXAMPLE USAGE:
./focs - calling without arguments will guide you through the process, but only run it from within the target firmwares root directory
./focs /path/to/binary @@ - this is the most basic usage of focs on a target binary. Pertinent inforamtion will not be collected.
./focs /directory/ - TODO######

Other help is coming!!!
