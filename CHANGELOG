Dec 8, 2019:
	- Fixed issue with non-x86 afl corpus minimizer not working
		- failure was due to an incorrect virtual memory setting
	
	- Fixed the color coding on the error/info messages

	- Instead of the silliness of copying the auto-fuzz.sh file, it is not a symbolic link
		- This is to prevent errors if the information in the script is updated

	- Forced backups of initial test case

Dec 10, 2019:
	- More fixes to the formatting of the scripts
		- Now allowed users to quit before the move ahead with unsupported distros
	
	- Added bold to the INFO text, so it is a bit easier on the eyes

	- Added more checks 
	
	- Adding a note to the TODO list:
		- Add a file in a folder called 'docs' called 'how_to_do_manually_what_FOCS_does_for_you.txt'
		- The purpose of this file is to describe what exactly is happening 'under the hood'
		- This will help users on unsupported distros figure out how to make AFL work on their distro
