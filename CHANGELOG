Dec 8, 2019:
	- Fixed issue with non-x86 afl corpus minimizer not working
		- failure was due to an incorrect virtual memory setting
	
	- Fixed the color coding on the error/info messages

	- Instead of the silliness of copying the auto-fuzz.sh file, it is not a symbolic link
		- This is to prevent errors if the information in the script is updated

	- Forced backups of initial test case
